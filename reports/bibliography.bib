abstract="This paper proposes a simple but effective graph-based agglomerative algorithm, for clustering high-dimensional data. We explore the different roles of two fundamental concepts in graph theory, indegree and outdegree, in the context of clustering. The average indegree reflects the density near a sample, and the average outdegree characterizes the local geometry around a sample. Based on such insights, we define the affinity measure of clusters via the product of average indegree and average outdegree. The product-based affinity makes our algorithm robust to noise. The algorithm has three main advantages: good performance, easy implementation, and high computational efficiency. We test the algorithm on two fundamental computer vision problems: image clustering and object matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-arts in both applications.",

  abstract = {We propose a simple method to extract the community structure of large networks. Our method is a heuristic method that is based on modularity optimization. It is shown to outperform all other known community detection methods in terms of computation time. Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2 million customers and by analysing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad hoc modular networks.}

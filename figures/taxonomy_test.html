<h1 id="building-a-bottom-up-industrial-taxonomy">3. Building a bottom-up industrial taxonomy</h1>
<p>In this section we summarise the results of an initial exploration of an approach to build a bottom-up industrial taxonomy using business descriptions from websites. It involves the following steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Extracting keywords and keyphrases (KW/KP) from business descriptions</li>
<li>Creating KW/KP networks based on their co-occurrence in business descriptions</li>
<li>Decomposing these networks into communities of frequently co-occurring KW/KPs that may refer to industries</li>
</ol>
<p>We have tested this approach with samples of companies from two 4-digit SIC codes. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>6201: Computer Programming Activities</li>
<li>7490: Other Professional, Scientific And Technical Activities Not Elsewhere Classified</li>
</ul>
<p>We have selected these two SIC codes because they illustrate two use cases where a bottom-up taxonomy may be particularly valuable: identifying sub-sectors that are developing or adopting emerging technologies and operating in new markets (in <code>6201</code>) and decomposing uninformative “Not elsewhere classified” sectors into more meaningful subsectors.</p>
<p>We outline the methodology in subsection 1 and emerging finding in subsection 2. Subsection 3 discusses limitations and next steps.</p>
<h2 id="methodology">1. Methodology</h2>
<p>We (pragmatically) define a sector as a set of companies that produce similar goods and services. One way to identify such sectors in a ‘bottom-up’, empirical way, is to look for co-occurrences of terms referring to goods and services in the same company description. Doing this requires building a vocabulary of relevant terms.</p>
<p>We have explored two avenues for this:</p>
<h3 id="a.-top-down-approach-united-nations-standard-product-and-service-classification-unspsc">a. Top-down approach: United Nations Standard Product and Service Classification (UNSPSC)</h3>
<p>The UNSPSC is a regularly updated taxonomy of products and services maintained by the UN. It contains 4 levels of aggregation (<em>segment</em>, <em>family</em>, <em>class</em> and <em>commodity</em>), with just under 148,000 commodities at the highest level of resolution.</p>
<p>This taxonomy could offer a principled and interpretable approach to identify mentions to products and services in business descriptions that we can then use to build our co-occurrence network. Unfortunately, we find that the terms used in UNSPSC have low overlap with the vocabulary in business descriptions. The main reason for this is that UNSPSC terms are often long, detailed and specific (see table 1 for some random examples).</p>

</table>
<p><strong>Table 2: UNSPSC category examples</strong></p>
<p>It is unlikely that firms selling these goods and services would mention them using the same language as UNSPSC in the descriptions that we have access to. The table illustrates that the taxonomy is highly unbalanced, with one of the families (<em>Healthcare Services</em>) comprising 73,000 commodities. We also find that the taxonomy does not include terms related to emerging technologies such as <em>Artificial Intelligence</em> or <em>Machine Learning</em>, an aspect of company activities that we are specially interested in capturing in the taxonomy.</p>
<h3 id="b.-bottom-up-approach-automated-keyword-and-keyphrase-extraction-methods">b. Bottom-up approach: Automated keyword and keyphrase extraction methods</h3>
<p>An alternative strategy is to exploit information about word positions in company descriptions in order to build sets of keywords and keyphrases (sets of frequently occurring words such as <em>web developer</em> or <em>building surveyor</em>) that we can then use to build our co-occurrence network. As part of this test, we have explored three algorithms to extract these keywords / keyphrases (KW/KPs).</p>
<ul>
<li><code>RAKE</code> (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extractor) is an algorithm that identifies frequently occurring sets of terms in documents that are not uninformative stopwords or separated by punctuation (Rose et al, 2010).</li>
<li><code>YAKE</code> (Yet Another Keyword Extractor) exploits further patterns in documents such as the position of a candidate KW/KP in a document (e.g. upweighting those that appear at the beginning) or the range of sentences where a candidate KW/KP occurs (Campos et al 2018).</li>
<li><code>KeyBERT</code> uses a pre-trained language model to identify KW/KPs in the document that are closest to it in vector space (more semantically similar / better able to summarie the document) (Sharma and Li, 2019).</li>
</ul>
<p>We note that all these algorithms operate at the document rather than corpus level. One potential avenue for further exploration is to adopt an ngram extraction strategy that identifies combinations of words that happen across the corpus at a higher rate than would be expected if they were statistically independent.</p>
<p>We use open source implementations of these three algorithms in order to test their suitability. Next section outlines our pipeline for this.</p>
<h2 id="results">3. Results</h2>
<p>Figure 1 present the steps in our pipeline.</p>

<h3 id="a.-creation-of-industry-vocabulary">a. Creation of industry vocabulary</h3>
<p>We begin with company descriptions extracted from business websites for our two selected sectors (this comprises 5,499 <code>6201</code> companies and 10,000 randomly sampled <code>7490</code> companies). We apply our three KW/KP algorithms to these descriptions and extract their frequencies in each of the corpora focusing on KW/KPs that occur at least twice in the corpus (terms that are present in a single company description are irrelevant for producing a co-occurrence network). We also flag those KW/KP that are present in a concatenation of the UNSPSC taxonomy (and which we would expect to be specially related to products and services).</p>
<p>This yields a list of KW/KPs for each 4-digit SIC and extraction methods with descriptive statistics presented in table 2.</p>

<p><strong>Table 2: Descriptive statistics for keywords</strong></p>
<p>Some observations: * <code>7490</code> yields more KW/KPs than <code>6201</code>. This may be partly explained by the fact we use a larger corpus of descriptions, and by the greater degree of heterogeneity in the company descriptions of that catch-all category. * KeyBERT yields fewer KW/KPs than alternative approaches. * The frequency distribution is highly skewed. Most keywords appear in very few documents (the top frequency quartile ranges between 2 and 4 words depending on the method). * In terms of performance, RAKE and YAKE are significantly faster than KeyBERT. RAKE takes 20 seconds to run over 10,000 <code>7490</code> company descriptions, YAKE takes 13 minutes and KeyBERT four hours (see figure 2, noting the logarithmic scale in the horizontal axis).</p>

<h3 id="b.-filtering-of-terms">b. Filtering of terms</h3>
<p>An initial inspection of the data reveals a strong presence of uninformative KW/KPs involving promotional and marketing terms that companies use in their websites. We have created a preliminary vocabulary of terms to filter those out. Any KW/KP including the terms below is removed from our candidate KW/KPs.</p>
<p><code>years experience   years of experience   quality   years   help   highest   experienced   trusted   award winning   growing   cost effective   efficient   proven   track record   best   solution   offer   company   client   partner   solutions   leader   offer   dedicated   prices   business   businesses   success</code></p>
<p>We also remove a long tail of low frequency KW/KPs with less than 5 occurrences in the corpus.</p>
<p>In Figure 3 we show the most frequent KW/KP in our corpus by SIC code and keyword extraction method. It shows that our extraction method seems to be capturing terms related to various industrial activities (<em>software</em>, <em>software development</em>, <em>training</em>, <em>health and safety</em>, <em>design</em>, <em>building surveying</em>, <em>management consultancy</em> and <em>social media</em> among others). We also note some leftover short and uninformative terms and promotional terms such as <em>wide range</em> (we have decided not to implement a rule to remove all short terms for now because this would also take out short acronyms often used in the ICT industry such as CRM - Customer Relationship Management - or ERP - Enterprise Resource Planning - that we have noticed in the data).</p>
<p>It also appear that, in general, KeyBERT is better at capturing longer and more detailed KPs describing what a business does.</p>

</figure>
<p>In Figure 4 we present the same information but only including terms that are not featured in UNSPSC according to our naive filter. It shows that while implementing the filter would help us to remove some irrelevant terms such as the location of a business in the UK, they also would lead us to lose many KW/KPs that are informative about what a business does and therefore relevant for the construction of our taxonomy. For this reason, we have decided not to apply the UNSPSC filter and keep all KW/KPs.</p>

</figure>
<h3 id="c.-network-building-and-community-extraction">c. Network building and community extraction</h3>
<p>We use our prototype industry vocabulary to build, for each of the SIC-4 codes we are exploring, a KW/KP co-occurrence network where every node is a KW/KP in our filtered set, and the weight of the edges represents the number of co-occurrences between connected nodes in the same industry description.</p>
<p>Our plan is to decompose this network into tightly connected communities of KW/KPs that might represent sub-sectors within our SIC codes. In order to simplify this process, aand following the strategy used by Hausmann and Hidalgo (2009), we build a maximum spanning tree of this network that only includes the highest weight edges that keep the network fully connected. We then apply the louvain community detection algorithm to the resulting network (this algorithm looks for partitions of a network that optimise its modularity i.e. extent to which the network can be decomposed into sub-groups including nodes that are tightly connected with each other and weakly connected with those in other subgroups).</p>
<p>Table 1 presents the resulting communities and related keywords for the SIC code <code>6201</code> and Table 2 focuses on <code>7490</code>.</p>
<p>These preliminary results suggest that the approach that we have piloted here has potential, but also some of the challenges that we need to tackle in order to develop a robust and intepretable bottom-up industrial taxonomy.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We note that the community detection extracts 18 communities in <code>6201</code> and 24 communities in <code>7490</code>. This suggests that there is significant potential to increase the sectoral resolution of 4-digit SIC codes.</li>
<li>When we look at the content of different communities we detect some evidence of sectoral coherence. Some examples of this include:
<ul>
<li><code>6201</code>: Communities 2 (Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data), 3 (app development), 4 (fintech), 7 (content management systems), 8 (digital marketing), 10 (enterprise software), 12 (web development), 13 (video games and virtual reality)</li>
<li><code>7490</code>: Communities 0 (oil and energy), 2 (solicitors), 7 (engineering and surveying), 8 (knowledge intensive consultancy including pharmaceutical and environmental), 15 (flood and safety assessments), 20 (chartered surveying, 24 (energy assessment)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We detect several irrelevant communities capturing uninformative terms such as locations, promotional and marketing terms and meaningless business language. Some examples include:
<ul>
<li><code>6201</code>: Communities 9, 14, 16</li>
<li><code>7490</code>: Communities 3,4,6,10,17,18,22</li>
</ul></li>

<p><strong>Table 4: Output KW/KP communities for SIC code <code>7490</code></strong></p>
<h2 id="next-steps">3. Next steps</h2>
<h3 id="a.-improve-kwkp-extraction">a. Improve KW/KP extraction</h3>
<p>Our first step is to improve KW/KP extraction. In particular, we need to remove terms that do not refer to a business’ productive activities. These include promotional and marketing expression, business bona fides and locations. Some potential avenues to do this include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expanding our stopword vocabulary with a larger set of terms perhaps including names of places in the metadata of ONS geographical datasets or named entity recognition for specific locations. This expansion could be done manually or using keyword expansion methods such as <code>word2vec</code> that identify terms that are semantically similar to those in a seed list.</li>
<li>Using parts-of-speech tagging to identify KW/KPs that are likely to be making promotional statements. As an example, adjective phrases such as <em>professional manner</em> and adverbial phrases such as <em>friendly service</em> are likely to fall in that category.</li>
<li>Removing short KWs/KPs</li>
<li>Using a document-wide ngram extraction strategy to expand our list of KWs and KPs.</li>
<li>Removing high degree nodes from the co-occurrence network once this has been created</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b.-scale-up-kwkp-extraction">b. Scale up KW/KP extraction</h3>
<p>Our improved KW/KP extraction protocol will need to be scaled over a corpus of more than half a million business descriptions matched with Companies House. This will require parallelisation, particularly to speed up the deployment of KeyBERT, which yields longer and more informative KW/KPs but taking orders of magnitude more time than alternative approaches such as RAKE and YAKE.</p>
<p>We also need to scale up our strategy for network creation and community building. In particular, we need to decide whether to build a network of <em>all</em> company descriptions and decompose it into communities (perhaps using a hierarchical community detection strategy), or take some elements of the SIC structure as given and look for subsectors inside it (along the lines of what we have done here). The first approach is more in line with the notion of building a wholly bottom up industrial taxonomy with a completeyly different structure from SIC. The second approach is computationally cheaper because it applies community detection to smaller networks eg defined around KW/KPs extracted at the 4-digit SIC.</p>
<h3 id="c.-develop-a-protocol-to-assign-companies-to-sectors">c. Develop a protocol to assign companies to sectors</h3>
<p>Having generated a set of communities with KW/KPs related to sectors, we will need to find a way to label these concisely. One option we are piloting is to query the KW/KPs in a sector community against wikipedia in order to obtain the closest article.</p>
<p>We also need to develop a strategy to classify companies into these bottom-up communities. One potential strategy to do this is to generate a labelled dataset of companies where a high share of KW/KP belong to a single community and train a supervised machine learning model using KW/KPs as features to predict community labels along the lines of what we have done in the first part of the project. This model can then be applied to the whole corpus. This approach would generate, for each company, a vector of probabilities for <em>all</em> bottom-up sectors in our labelled dataset, which we can use to identify companies operating in multiple sectors, and to meaasure similarities and differences between sectors independently from their position in the SIC taxonomy.</p>
